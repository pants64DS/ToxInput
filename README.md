# ToxInput 0.7 (beta) by pants64

This program makes it possible to play SM64DS with "360 degree" joystick controls.
Only compatible with European ROMs and the latest 64 bit X432R version of DeSmuME (0.9.12).
It works with hacked ROMs too, unless they have changed code in certain places.

How to use:

1. Make sure an Xbox controller is connected
2. Start ToxInput
3. Select the right emulator window. If you can't it means that the game or the emulator isn't compatible.
4. Choose the settings you want by clicking the check boxes. You can't change the first two check boxes
after leaving the file select screen if you're using JIT mode.
